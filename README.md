## Introduction

Welcome to `fastapi-keycloak`. This projects goal is to ease the integration of Keycloak (OpenID Connect) with Python, especially FastAPI. FastAPI is not necessary but is
encouraged due to specific features. Currently, this package supports only the `password` and the `authorization_code`. However, the `get_current_user()` method accepts any JWT 
that was signed using Keycloak's private key.

**This package is currently under development and is not yet officially released. However, you may still use it and contribute to it.**

## TLDR;

FastAPI Keycloak enables you to do the following things without writing a single line of additional code:

- Verify identities and roles of users with Keycloak
- Get a list of available identity providers
- Create/read/delete users
- Create/read/delete roles
- Assign/remove roles from users
- Implement the `password` or the `authorization_code` flow (login/callback/logout)

## Example

This example assumes you use a frontend technology (such as React, Vue, or whatever suits you) to render your pages and merely depicts a `protected backend`

### app.py

```python
import uvicorn
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends

from fastapi_keycloak import FastAPIKeycloak, OIDCUser

app = FastAPI()
idp = FastAPIKeycloak(
    server_url="https://auth.some-domain.com/auth",
    client_id="some-client",
    client_secret="some-client-secret",
    admin_client_secret="admin-cli-secret",
    realm="some-realm-name",
    callback_uri="http://localhost:8081/callback"
)
idp.add_swagger_config(app)

@app.get("/admin")
def admin(user: OIDCUser = Depends(idp.get_current_user(required_roles=["admin"]))):
    return f'Hi premium user {user}'


@app.get("/user/roles")
def user_roles(user: OIDCUser = Depends(idp.get_current_user)):
    return f'{user.roles}'


if __name__ == '__main__':
    uvicorn.run('app:app', host="127.0.0.1", port=8081)
```
